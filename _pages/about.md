# Hello, I'm Mr. Sầu

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I am a **Software Engineer** currently living and working in the beautiful city of **Sydney**.

### The Surgeon Who Learned to Code
My journey didn't start with computers. Growing up in Vietnam, my first dream was to become a surgeon. I was so obsessed with biology that I used to spend my scorching summer breaks out in the fields catching frogs to perform "surgery" (apologies if that sounds a bit gruesome to some of you!). I would meticulously dissect, record, and draw detailed diagrams of their anatomy, from the structure of the heart to the complex network of blood vessels.

However, "the career chose the man." During my final years of middle school, I was chosen for the IT team and began helping my teacher set up projectors in the lab. That spark of curiosity changed everything. I traded my surgical dreams for a copy of "VB.Net Programming," which I bought in the summer of 2015 using my breakfast savings.

### From 512MB RAM to Sydney
My path to becoming an engineer was built on persistence and a few humble tools:
* **The First Rig:** I started on an old CRT monitor PC with only 512MB of RAM. Since my house had no internet, my father saved up 500,000 VNĐ to buy me a Viettel 3G Dcom so I could finally connect to the world.
* **The Grind:** My passion was often mistaken for a gaming addiction. I remember the "horrible" time before high school entrance exams when my computer was confiscated, and I was forced into extra classes from 5 PM to 10 PM every day.

Ultimately, that stubborn focus led me to win several Science & Technology awards in high school, which eventually paved the way for scholarships to study and work in Australia.

### A Quick "Confession" (Note)
> I'll be honest: I wasn't a "straight-A" student, and I’ve never been good at academic, theory-only learning. I only truly learn when I get my hands dirty and practice. 
>
> Back in high school, there were many times I couldn't solve the problems and had to ask—or "borrow" a look at—my friends' papers. I was scolded by teachers and teased by peers; reflecting on it now, I feel quite shy about it! If any of my old teachers or classmates are reading this, please accept my sincere apologies. To the younger students: please don't follow this part of my journey. Don't let your passion overshadow your studies or the environment around you—find your balance!

### Why this Blog?
I created this space to document my personal journey and growth within the software industry. This is where I share:
* **Technical Insights:** Real-world lessons in system design and clean code.
* **Engineering Abroad:** My experiences navigating the tech industry in Australia.
* **Life Beyond the Screen:** My morning Long Black rituals, the books that shape my perspective, and the freedom of road-tripping along Australia’s stunning coastlines.

I hope my stories offer you some inspiration or a bit of value. Feel free to reach out if you share these passions or just want to chat about tech!
